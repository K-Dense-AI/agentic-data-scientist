# Coding Planning Phase

This prompt would typically define how the coding agent should plan its implementation before execution. For now, this functionality is integrated into the main coding_base.md instructions.

Key planning aspects covered in coding_base.md:
- Pre-execution inspection (Step -1)
- Workspace organization (Step 0)
- Environment setup (Step 1)
- Data validation planning (Step 2)
- Core implementation planning (Step 3)

This file is kept as a placeholder for potential future enhancements to the planning phase.
